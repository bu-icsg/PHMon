vuln2 is the static binary, there is no need to recompile.
The only change will be made in payload3.py
First disable ASLR
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
run ./vuln3
It will return 3 addresses, the important one buffer, the others should be same

if you get buffer=0x3ffffffb88, the payload will work fine
Otherwise, record buffer address

go to payload3.py
find return to a injected code address comment
change that address with buffer addr+4
./paylaod3.py > payload3.txt

cat payload3.txt | ./vuln3
This should print hacked
